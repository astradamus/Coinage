/**
 * This behavior will make the agent wander to a random point, not by picking a point and pathing to
 * it, but by chaining together a random series of movements. We pick a direction and start moving
 * in it. If we hit a blocked square we immediately pick a new direction. Each time we move without
 * hitting a blocked square, there's a chance we will still pick a new direction anyways. Each
 * wander will last for a limited number of direction changes, and is complete when that number is
 * fulfilled.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * Note that a sensory scan will be performed after each completed movement, but not in between
 * them.
