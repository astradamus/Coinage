/**
 * This behavior will make the agent respond to a sound produced by a given intruder. The agent will
 * turn towards the source of the original sound, performing a limited sensory scan each update that
 * only seeks the intruder who made the sound. This is done instead of performing a regular sensory
 * scan purely to conserve processing power. This could potentially raise weird behavioral issues,
 * where one actor causes an investigation that results in the agent completely ignoring some other
 * actor that walks up to kill it. However, as it stands now, the odds of this happening are very
 * low, and the odds of it being noticed by the player if it does happen are even lower.
